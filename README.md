# Eat-da-burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works.


<h2>Node Express Handlebars</h2>
Overview:
<br>
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTM


# Alex's Notes

## ok, I've added to this repo the suggested solution for this homework.

I fixed a couple bugs which you can see in the commit history.

From here.... you should be able to debug your homework and figure out what was wrong as you go along. 

You should be Googling along to find out what certain html attributes do and why they are used and anything else that looks unfamiliar. 

I believe that using the commit where I have fixed a couple bugs along with the suggested solution you should be able to figure out multiple places where you might have went wrong. 

Once you've fixed all the bugs and it works. 

See if you can do it from scratch again while looking up EVERYTHING you don't understand.
